# ASN.1 Spec We are able to Parse

This directory contains the ASN.1 Specs we are able to parse successfully.

Also a simple script `parse_specs.py` can be used to generate the ASN files
from the specs file. This is a very basic Proof Of Concept script right now.
The specification file will have to be downloaded on a local path.

This can be further automated to download the specifications.
